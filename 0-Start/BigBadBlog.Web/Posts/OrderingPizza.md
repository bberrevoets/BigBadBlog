I'm feeling lazy today, so I think I'll order some pizza. I'm not sure what I want yet, but I'll figure it out. I'm thinking about getting a large pepperoni pizza, but I might change my mind. I'll let you know what I decide. 

There's this really cool new pizza shop that opened down the street called Blazing Pizza.  I think I'll give them a try
